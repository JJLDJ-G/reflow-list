This file illustrates what reflowList can do to badly formatted text.  ReflowList finds the paragraph around the cursor
and reformats it.
For this illustration, the wrap column was set to 60.

   // This is in a C++/Java/Javascript/Typescript comment.  blah blah blah.
   //   An indented paragraph.  ReflowList won't confuse paragraphs with different indentations.
   //
   //   It also supports lists:
   //   1.  Lists can be numeric, as
   //       shown here.
   //   2.  They can also be alphabetic, e.g., like this nested list:
   //      a) Parenthesis or periods may follow the list marker.
   //      B. This is an alphabetic list element.
   // To make this really useful, you should bind reflowList.reflowParagraph to some key.

   # This is in a python/perl/whatever comment.  It also shows a different kind of list.
   # - reflowList handles bulleted lists.
   #   The second line of each list element is correctly indented and wrapped.
   # o The list marker may be '-' or 'o', followed by a space.  This is customizable.

  ReflowList also supports description lists, which are particularly handy for function argument documentation.

  Args:
    arg1: This is a special argument.
      Text can be wrapped; subsequent lines are indented extra spaces.
    arg2: This is another argument with some text that will wrap.
